## Vehicle Prediction using YOLOv5
Welcome to the "Vehicle Prediction using YOLOv5" GitHub repository!
This project showcases a robust solution for vehicle detection and prediction using the YOLOv5 object detection framework.
In addition to the code and model, we provide the dataset used for training and the resulting prediction images.

## Introduction
The "Vehicle Prediction using YOLOv5" project focuses on automating the process of identifying and predicting vehicles in images. 
The YOLOv5 framework, renowned for its real-time object detection capabilities, has been tailored to recognize various types of vehicles, 
from cars and trucks to motorcycles and bicycles. 
This project finds applications in traffic monitoring, smart city planning, and surveillance systems.

## Dataset
Our repository includes the dataset we used to train the YOLOv5 model. 
This dataset is curated with a diverse range of vehicle images, annotated with bounding boxes to define vehicle positions. 
This meticulously annotated data forms the foundation for training the model to accurately predict vehicles in various settings.

## Prediction Images
Explore the "prediction_images" directory to view the outcome of our trained model's predictions. 
These images offer a visual representation of the YOLOv5 model in action, demonstrating its proficiency 
in detecting and labeling vehicles in real-world images.
